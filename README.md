# Game Snake With Pygame

The Snake Game project using Pygame is an implementation of the classic game Snake in which the player controls a snake that grows longer every time it eats food, with the goal of avoiding hitting the snake's own body. This project uses the Pygame library to create graphical displays and handle game logic.
